Operating system:
- Manages computer hardware
- Provides basis for application programs
- Acts as intermediary between the user and hardware

Computer can be divided into 4 systems
1. Hardware
2. Operating system
3. Application programs
4. Users

Hardware includes: CPU, memory, input output devices provide compute resources
Application programs define the way in which the hardware resources are used to solve computing problems
Operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for different users. 
Operating system provides the means for proper use of the hardware, software and data resources of a computer
- The operating system manages system resources, acting like a resource allocator.
- The operating system must decide how to efficiently allocate resources to applications and users in order to operate the computer system efficiently
- The O/S is also a control program. It manages the execution of user programs in order to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
- The O/S both allocates and controls resources

What is an operating system?
----------------------------
The one program running at all times on the computer i.e. the kernel


Types of programs
-----------------
System programs - Are associated with the operating system but are not part of th kernel
Application programs - All programs not associated with the operation of the system

COMPUTER SYSTEM ORGANISATION
----------------------------
- Modern general purpose computer consists of:
  - >= 1 CPU
  - Several device controllers connected through a common bus that provides shared access to memory
  - Each controller is in charge of a specific type of device (disk drives, audio devices, video displays)
- The CPU and the device controllers can execute concurrently, competing for memory.
- To ensure orderly access to the sahred memory, a memory controller is provided whose function is to synchronise access to memory

- The initial program(firmware) ran on start/boot is stored in ROM or EEPROM (Erasable programmable Read Only Memory)
- It initialises all aspects of the system - CPU registers, device controllers, memory ..
- It must know how to load the operating system and also how to start executing the system. It must locate and load the O/S kernel into memory
- Once the O/S is loaded into memory, the O/S then starts executing its first process then waits for an event to occur
- The occurrence of an event is usually signalled by an interrupt from the hardware or software.
-  Hardware/Software may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending an interrupt signal to the CPU
- When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and transfers execution to a fixed location that contains the starting address where the service for the routine is located.
- The interrupt service executes and on completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation


Storage structure
-----------------
- CPU can load instructions only fmo memory
- ANy programs to run must be stored in memory
- Main memory is commonly implemented in DRAM - Dynamic RAM
- Only static programs are store in ROM or EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable ROM)

- All forms of memory provide an array of words, each word having its own address
- Storing is achieved through a sequence of load or store instructions to specific memory addresses
- Load moves a word from main memory to an internal register within the CPU
- Store moves the content of a register to RAM/Main memory
- For a system with a von Neumann architecture,
-  The system fetches an instruction from memory and stores the instruction in the instruction register in the CPU
- The instruction is decoded and may cause operands to be fetched from memory and stored in some internal register
- After the instruction on the operands has been executed, the result may be stored back in memory
